# 🏆KAGGLE\_COMPETITION\_AND\_OTHER\_NOTEBOOKS

This repository contains a collection of **Kaggle competition solutions** as well as **standalone machine learning notebooks**. It features complete data pipelines, exploratory analyses, model development, evaluation techniques, and more — offering both competition-specific and general ML problem-solving examples.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* 📁 `data/` – Raw or processed datasets (where permitted by license or competition rules)
* 📄 `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for Kaggle competitions: includes EDA, model training, and result analysis
* 📄 `ml_notebooks/` – General-purpose machine learning notebooks covering various datasets and ML problems
* 🧠 `models/` – Trained model files or scripts used for training models
* ⚙️ `scripts/` – Utility scripts for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and submission
* 📈 `results/` – Performance summaries, evaluation metrics, visualizations, and competition standings

> **Note:** All resources are shared for educational and reference purposes only. Included datasets follow their respective licenses and usage permissions.

## 💡 Purpose

This repository is intended to:

* Showcase practical data science workflows using real-world datasets
* Demonstrate solution strategies for Kaggle competitions and custom ML tasks
* Serve as a reference for best practices in data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation
* Provide diverse ML solutions, from traditional algorithms to deep learning models

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore or reproduce a project:

1. Navigate to a specific competition folder (`notebooks/`) or general ML notebook (`ml_notebooks/`)
2. Follow any setup instructions provided in that folder’s README (if available)
3. Use the notebooks and scripts to explore or reproduce results

## 📌 Requirements

Most projects are based on Python and use libraries such as:

* `pandas`, `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* `xgboost`, `lightgbm`
* `tensorflow` / `pytorch` (for deep learning)

Dependencies may vary by project. Check the relevant folder or a `requirements.txt` file if provided.
